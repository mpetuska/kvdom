   * is only triggered on the div element because it is the only element being detached from its parent.

   * to additionally animate the disappearance of the removed element's children.

   * The handling function receives both the vnode and a callback. You can control and delay the removal with the callback.
   * The callback should be invoked once the hook is done doing its business, and the element will only be removed once all
   * remove hooks have invoked their callback.
   *
   * The hook is only triggered when an element is to be removed from its parent â€“ not if it is the child of an
   * element that is removed. For that, see the destroy hook.
